PIAX (P2P Interactive Agent eXtensions) is an open source framework that integrates P2P strucutred overlay network and agent platform.

Overlay network enables pervasive devices to communicate each other efficently, while agent platform on the overlay network encourages the devices to cooperate with other devices. Consequently, a scalable and efficient federated system can be realized not only in the ordinary environment but also in a large-scale distributed environment (e.g., pervasive environment, cloud environment) where various kinds of data and processes are located in each device.
